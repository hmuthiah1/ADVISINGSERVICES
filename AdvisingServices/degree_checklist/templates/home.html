        Student advising is a process that helps students map out a plan for academic success and ensure their goals are met. During advising, the student becomes eligible to register using universityâ€™s online registration system, through a process called "greenlighting."
    </p>
    <h2>Scheduling an Appointment</h2>
    <b>To schedule an advising and greenlighting appointment with Advising Services, please call (xxx) xxx-xxxx.</b>
    <p>
        All undergraduate students must be advised and greenlighted every semester to be eligible for registration. Some programs recommend, and a few require, all their major students regardless of the number of hours completed to be pre-advised in the department before being greenlighted by Advising Services.
